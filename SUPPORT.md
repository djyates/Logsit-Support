## Adding a new action

To start tracking something, just tap the plus button on the home screen and type in the title, e.g. "Cleaned rabbit hutch". Once you press 'save' this action will be added to your home screen and you can start checking in.

## Checking in

**Swiping.** Find the action on your home screen and swipe it from left to right to check in. You can add some notes and change the time if you like or you can just hit the 'Check In' button on the top right to confirm the check in.

**Via details page.** You can also check in from the details page: tap the action on your home screen and then hit the check-in button.

## Change the sort order

By default, actions on your home screen are sorted alphabetically. To change this, tap the cog button on the top left and tap the 'Main sort order' row to toggle between alphabetical, check-in count and time since.

## Editing an existing action

Find the action you'd like to edit on your home screen and tap it. At the top right of this details page is an ellipsis icon, tapping here lets you edit the action name, reminder and location.

## Editing a check-in

Tap the relevant action on your home screen to go to its details page. Find the check-in you'd like to edit and tap it. From here you can add or edit your notes, change the time and add your current location.

## Setting a reminder

You can set a reminder either when you create a new action or when you edit an existing one. Tap the switch to 'on' and choose how long you'd like to go between checking in to this action, e.g. '2 weeks'. You'll be reminded this length of time after each check-in. Because reminders are triggered when you check in, if you stop checking-in the reminders will stop too.

## Turn location on/off

Location is set to off by default when you create a new action. If you'd like to add your location to check-ins automatically when you check-in, just turn the switch to on when creating or editing the action.

## View my check-in locations

Tap the action you want to view on your home screen. On the details page tap the map icon on the bottom right of the screen. This will bring up a map showing pins for each check-in.

## Sharing a check-in

Tap the relevant action on your home screen to go to its details page. Find the check-in you'd like to share and tap it. The share button is on the bottom left of the screen. You'll get a choice of sharing methods and the opportunity to edit the text before sending.

## Deleting an action

Find the action you'd like to delete on your home screen and tap it. Hit the ellipsis icon in the top right of the screen. Now tap the trash icon on the bottom right of the 'Edit Action' page and then press 'Delete Action' to confirm. PLEASE NOTE: this will delete your action and ALL of its associated check-ins, notes and locations. It can't be undone!

## Deleting a check-in

Tap the relevant action on your home screen to go to its details page. Find the check-in you'd like to delete in the timeline and swipe from right to left to reveal the delete button. Alternatively you can tap the check-in and hit the delete button.
