## Data Collection and Usage

Logsit does not sell or rent your data. The only data collected is anonymous and is used solely to improve the app’s performance and user experience.

## Crash and Error Reporting

No personally identifiable information (PII) is sent to Sentry, ensuring that data cannot be used to track you. All data sent to Sentry is stored in the European Union (Frankfurt, Germany). You can read Sentry’s privacy policy [here](https://sentry.io/privacy/).

## Analytics

Logsit also uses [PostHog](https://posthog.com), a third-party analytics provider, to help us understand usage trends and improve the app. The data collected is completely anonymous and does not include personal information such as your recorded location, action titles, or note content. You can review PostHog’s privacy policy [here](https://posthog.com/privacy).
